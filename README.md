<h3>Pizza project</h3>
<br>
<p>This projects is a pizza menu and has the programming langauage for you to order food and it'll calculate it for you! It has many different types if meats/veggies that go on your pizza!</p>
<br>
<h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
<br>
<p> I created a fully function Tic Tac Toe game that has different sounds and pictures when you place your x or o down. I plan on working on it a bit longer to make it with content and sounds that kids have on other games that they enjoy plying!</p>
<br>
<h3>Calculator</h3>
<br>
<p>This Calculator works really well and can set it into any website needing a calculator! Meaning it might look a little bigger at the moment but can be set to work with another website after just adding it in and changing some some touches to it! </p>
